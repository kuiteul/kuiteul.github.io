                                                                                    #JavaScript: is a popular language that we can't bypass if we want to build a good webpage or web apps. Many frameworks use JavaScript as source code to build a sort of new programming language such as: React, NodeJs, jQuery, etc.

Notice: JavaScript is different from Java. One is the most used as a scripting language (JavaScript).
